# cuteliltimer
Everytime I'm taking a break at school and someone walks in I worry they might be thinking that I don't study and only scroll on my phone so I made this cute timer app thingy so that they can see that I'm taking a short break or that I've been studying for over an hour. These are only the css &amp; html files, you need to write your own js.

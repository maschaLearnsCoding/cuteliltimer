# cuteliltimer
Everytime I'm taking a break at school and someone walks in I worry they might be thinking that I don't study and only scroll on my phone so I made this cute timer app thingy so that they can see that I'm taking a short break or that I've been studying for over an hour. These are only the css & html files, you need to write your own js. I also didn't include a bunch of other files one might need to turn this whole thing into a desktop app that doesn't load on a webpage. I also didn't include the pictures I used. If you wanna use my code you should make sure that the names of all the files that you're using are IDENTIICAL to the ones written in these codes. Happy coding :)m
